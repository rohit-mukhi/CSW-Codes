We use stringbuilder and stringbuffer to create mutable strings.
buffer is sychronized, thread safe and slower, works with single-threading
builder is non-sychronized, not thread safe and faster, multi-threaded

Comparable interface is not used in sbf and sbd because strings become mutable here.

Inside a interface if any method is declared default then it is not complusory to override that method. If you access an interface through an abstract class in that case also overriding is not necessary.
